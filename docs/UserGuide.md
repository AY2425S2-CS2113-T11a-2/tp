## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: You can simply move over data.txt to the same directory as LogJob.jar anywhere, and LogJob will be synchronised!

**Q**: How do I save my data?

**A**: No need to manually save your data! LogJob will automatically save your data to your computer whenever you exit the application.

## Known Issues

1. When the terminal window is not large enough to display the whole row of application, the row will be wrapped around by the terminal, this is due to the limitation of Command Line Interface.<br>
![issue](images/knownIssue.png)
Try to enlarge or full screen the terminal when encountering such issue, refrain from adding company names or job titles that are too long.
